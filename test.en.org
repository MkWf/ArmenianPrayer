The Divine Liturgy of the Armenian Church
THE PREPARATION
VESTING
The laws of serving the Church. Whenever the Priest wishes to offer a Liturgy, it is required to dress himself in such a symbolic way. Enter the vestry with the Deacons where the vestments are for the Liturgy, and having vested, each according to his official position and rank, they then say then.
Psalm 132
Refrain. Let your priests clothe themselves with righteousness; and let your saints exult with joy.
Antiphon. Lord, remember David and all his meekness.
How he swore to the Lord; and vowed to the God of Jacob.
Surely I will not enter into the tabernacle of my house; nor go up into the couch of my bed.
I will not give sleep to my eyes; or slumber to my eyelids, nor rest to my temples, until I find the place for the temple of the Lord God of Jacob.
Behold, we heard of the same at Ephrathah; we found it in the fields of the woods.
Let us go into his tabernacles; let us worship at the place where his feet stood.
Arise, O Lord, to your resting place; you and the ark of your holiness.
Let your priests clothe themselves with righteousness; and let your saints exult with joy.
For your beloved David’s sake, do not turn your face away from your anointed.
The Lord has sworn in truth to David, and has not lied to him; of the fruit of his loins he will set upon his throne.
If your children will keep my covenant, and my testimony which I shall teach them,
Their children shall also sit upon your throne forevermore.
For the Lord was pleased at Zion, and he chose to live on it, saying: This is my rest forever, here I will dwell, for I was pleased at it.
I will abundantly bless her widows; and I will satisfy her poor with bread.
I will also clothe her priests with salvation; and her saints shall exult with joy.
There I will make the horn of David to grow; I will prepare a lamp for my anointed.
His enemies will I clothe with shame; but upon himself my holiness shall flourish.
Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit;
Now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
The Deacon
Again in peace let us beseech the Lord.
Let us ask of the Lord in faith with one accord that he may bestow on us the grace of his mercy.
May the almighty Lord our God save us and have mercy on us.
And they say twelve times
Lord, have mercy.
The Priest
O Jesus Christ our Lord, clothed with light as with a garment, you appeared upon earth in unspeakable humility and walked with men. You became eternal high priest after the order of Melchizedek and have adorned your holy church.
Lord almighty, having granted us to put on the same heavenly garment, make me, your useless servant, also worthy at this hour when I make bold to approach the same spiritual service of your glory, so that I may divest myself of all ungodliness, which is a vile garment, and that I may be adorned with your light. Cast away my wickedness from me and shake me out of my transgressions that I may be made worthy of the light prepared by you in the world to come.
Grant me to enter with priestly glory upon the ministry of your holy things together with those who have kept your commandments without sinning, so that I also may be found prepared for the heavenly nuptial chamber with the wise virgins to glorify you, Christ, who bore the sins of all. For you are the holiness of our souls and to you, beneficent God, is befitting glory, dominion and honor, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
The Deacon
Again in peace let us beseech the Lord:
Receive us, save us, and have mercy on us.
The Priest
Blessing and glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
And after the blessing, he first puts the crown [saghavard] on his head, saying:
Lord, put the helmet of salvation upon my head to fight against the powers of the enemy, by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ to whom is befitting glory, dominion and honor, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
For the alb [shabeeg]
Clothe me, Lord, with the garment of salvation and with a robe of gladness, and gird me with this vestment of salvation, by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ to whom is befitting glory, dominion and honor, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
For the stole [poroorar]
Clothe my neck, O Lord, with righteousness and cleanse my heart from all filthiness of sin, by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom is befitting glory, dominion and honor, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
For the belt [kodee]
May the girdle of faith encircle me round about my heart and my mind and quench vile thoughts out of them; and may the power of your grace abide in them at all times, by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom is befitting glory, dominion and honor, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
For the maniple [pazban] on the right and left hands
Give strength, Lord, to my right (or left) hand and wash all my filthiness, that I may be able to serve you in health of soul and body, by the grace of our Lord, Jesus Christ, to whom is befitting glory, dominion and honor, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
For the amice [vagas]
Clothe my neck, Lord, with righteousness and cleanse my heart from all filthiness of sin, by the grace of our Lord, Jesus Christ, to whom is befitting glory, dominion and honor, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
For the cope [shoorchar]
In your mercy, Lord, clothe me with a radiant garment and fortify me against the influence of the evil one, that I may be worthy to glorify your glorious name, by the grace of our Lord, Jesus Christ, to whom is befitting glory, dominion and honor, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen
After putting on the sacred vestments, he says
My soul will rejoice in the Lord, for he has clothed me with a raiment of salvation and with a robe of gladness. He has put upon me a crown as upon a bridegroom and has adorned me like a bride with jewels, by the grace of our Lord, Jesus Christ, to whom is befitting glory, dominion and honor, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
For the towel
Cleanse my hands, Lord, from all filthiness of sin, by the grace of our Lord, Jesus Christ, to whom is befitting glory, dominion and honor, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
After the priest has vested, he processes from the vestry into the sanctuary while the choir sings the following:
O mystery deep, inscrutable, without beginning, you have decked your supernal realm as a nuptial chamber to the light unapproachable and adorned with splendid glory the ranks of the fiery spirits.
With ineffably wondrous power you created Adam, the lordly image, and clothed him with gracious glory in the paradise of Eden, the place of delights.
Through the passion of your holy Only-begotten all creation has been renewed and man has again been made immortal, adorned in an indespoilable raiment.
Heavenly king, preserve your Church unshaken and keep in peace those who worship your name.
PURIFICATION
Psalm 26
Prs. I will wash my hands in innocence; and will go around your altar, O Lord.
Dcn. Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in my integrity I have trusted in the Lord that I may not slip.
Examine me, O Lord, and prove me; try out my mind and my heart.
Your mercy, O Lord, is before my eyes; and I shall be well pleased with your truth.
I shall not sit in the seats of the vain; neither will I go in with the lawless.
I have hated assembly of evildoers; I will not sit among the ungodly.
I will wash my hands in innocence; and I will go around your altar, O Lord.
That I may hear the voice of your blessing; and tell of all your wondrous works.
Lord, I have loved the beauty of your house; and the place your glory dwells.
Destroy not my soul with the ungodly; nor my life with those who shed blood;
Whose hands are in iniquity, and whose right hand is full of bribes.
As for me, I have walked innocently; deliver me, O Lord, and be merciful to me.
My foot shall stand aright;
In the great congregations I will praise you.
Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit,
Now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
The Priest
By the intercession of the holy Mother of God, O Lord, receive our supplications and save us.
The Deacon
Let us hold the holy Mother of God and all the saints as intercessors with the Father in heaven, that he may be pleased to have mercy and compassion on us, his creatures, and save us. Almighty Lord, our God, save us and have mercy on us.
The Priest
Lord, receive, our supplications through the intercession of the holy Mother of God, the immaculate bearer of your only-begotten Son, and by the supplications of all your saints. Hear us, Lord, and have mercy on us; forgive, expiate and remit our sins; make us worthy to give you thanks and to glorify you together with the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
I confess before God and before the holy Mother of God and before all the saints and before you (fathers and brothers), all the sins that I have committed; for I have sinned in thought, word and deed and with all the sins that men commit. I have sinned, I have sinned; I pray you, ask of God forgiveness for me.
One of the priests or one nearby answers:
May God the almighty have mercy on you and grant you forgiveness of all your transgressions of the past and the present. May he deliver you from those that are to come, confirm you in all good works, and give you rest in the life of the age to come. Amen.
The Priest
May God, who loves mankind, also set you free and may he remit all your transgressions. May he give you time to repent and to do good works. May he also direct your life in the time to come by the grace of the Holy Spirit, the mighty and the merciful, and to him be glory forever. Amen.
The People
Remember us also before the immortal Lamb of God.
The Priest
You will be remembered before the immortal Lamb of God.
Psalm 100
Make a shout to the Lord, all lands; serve the Lord with gladness.
Enter into his presence with joy; know that he is the Lord our God.
It is he who made us and we were not by ourselves; we are his people and the sheep of his pasture.
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving; and into his courts with praise.
Be thankful to the Lord; and bless his name.
The Lord is gracious, his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endures from generation to generation.
Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit,
Now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
The Deacon
Through the holy Church let us beseech the Lord that through her he may deliver us from sin and may save us by the grace of his mercy. Almighty Lord our God, save us and have mercy.
The Priest
In the midst of this temple, Lord, and before these holy signs and before this holy place that hold God up to us and are made resplendent, we bow down in awe and worship; we glorify your holy, wondrous and triumphant lordship, and we offer praise and glory to you with the Father and with the Holy Spirit, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
And going up to the altar, the priest says with the deacon
Psalm 43
I will go in before the altar of God; to God who makes my youth joyful.
Judge me, O God; do justice to me in my trial.
Deliver me from a generation that is not holy; from a sinful and deceitful person.
You, God,  are the giver of my strength; why have you forgotten me? Why do I go sadly while my enemy oppresses me?
Send out, O Lord, your light and your truth that they may lead me and bring me to your holy mountain and to your tabernacle.
I will go in before the altar of God; to God who makes my youth joyful.
I will give thanks to you with praises, O God my God.
Then why are you grieved, O my soul, and why do you trouble me? Hope in God, give thanks to him; the deliverer of my countenance is God.
Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit,
Now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
The Deacon
Again in peace let us beseech the Lord.
Let us bless the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has made us worthy to stand in this place of praise and to sing spiritual songs.
Almighty Lord our God, save us and have mercy.
The Priest
In this dwelling of holiness, this place of praise; in this habitation of angels, this place of the expiation of mankind; before these holy signs and the holy place that hold God up to us and are made resplendent, we bow down in awe and worship. We bless and glorify your holy, wondrous and triumphant lordship and, together with the heavenly hosts, we offer blessing and glory to you with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
If the celebrant is a bishop, the choir sings “O Chosen of God” while the bishop is inaudibly saying the prayer to the Holy Spirit. But if the celebrant is a priest, the curtain is closed and the choir sings a melody proper to the day.
Prayer to the Holy Spirit by St. Gregory of Narek (33)
Almighty, beneficent, lover of humankind, God of all, maker of things seen and unseen, savior and restorer, provident and peacemaker, O mighty Spirit of the Father, we implore you with open arms and pray, sobbing, in your awe-inspiring presence.
We draw near with much trembling and utmost trepidation to offer first this intelligible sacrifice to your inscrutable power, as One who shares the inalienable honor of the Father in reign, in glory and in creation; to you, the searcher of the hidden depths of the mysteries of the most perfect will of the Father of Emmanuel, who sends you and who is the Savior, the Giver of life and the Creator of all. 
Through you the three persons of the One Godhead were made known to us, O incomprehensible One who is recognized as one among them. In you and through you the early descendents of the patriarchal family, called seers, recounted in plain language the things past and the things to come, those that had happened and those that are yet to happen.
 O Spirit of God, by having proclaimed yourself through Moses as the one moving over the waters, boundless power that you are, and by your overwhelming, encircling care, brooding and protecting the newly-born under your wings with compassion, you made known the mystery of the baptismal font.
In the pattern of the archetype, before constructing the pliable substance with its final covering, you formed in lordly fashion, O Mighty one, the complete natures of all things out of nothing, of all beings, of all existences out of no existence. Through you shall all these your creatures be renewed at the resurrection, in that time which is the last day of this life and the first day in the land of the living. The first-born Son, being your kin and of the same essence of the Father, obeyed you also with oneness of will, as he did his Father. While in our likeness, he proclaimed you as true God, equal and consubstantial to his mighty Father. He declared blasphemy against you to be unforgivable and he stopped the impious mouths of those who rebel against you, as of those who fight against God, though he forgave blasphemy against himself, the righteous and the spotless one, finder of all, who was betrayed for our sins and rose for our justification.
Glory to him through you, and praise to you with the Father almighty, unto the ages of ages. Amen.
I shall go on repeating in the same sequence of words until the certainty in the upward contemplation of light is miraculously revealed, stirring us to proclaim anew the good news of ever more peace.
We beseech and implore you with tearful sighs from our utmost being, O glorified Creator, incorruptible and uncreated, eternal and compassionate Spirit, who with unutterable implorations intercede for us with the merciful Father. You keep the saints, you cleanse the sinners and you make them temples of the living and life-giving will of the exalted Father.
Deliver us now from all unclean deeds that are not proper for those in whom you dwell, and may the shining light of your gifts not be extinguished within the reflective eyes of our understanding, for we have learned that you do unite with us in prayer and in commendable lives that are offered as incense.
And inasmuch as one of the Trinity is being offered and another accepts the sacrifice, pleased with us through the reconciling blood of his First-born, so may you also accept our supplications and prepare us to be honored dwellings, always ready to partake worthily of the heavenly Lamb, to receive without the sentence of condemnation this manna of life eternal, of the new deliverance.
And may our faltering be consumed by this fire, as that of the Prophet was consumed by the live burning coal offered to him with the tongs, so that in everything your mercy may be proclaimed, as the loving kindness of the Father was proclaimed through the Son, who brought the prodigal son back to the paternal inheritance and led the harlots into the heavenly kingdom, that blessed realm of the righteous. 
Yes, indeed! I too am one of them. Receive me also with them as one who is in need of much of that love for humankind, as one who is saved by your grace and redeemed by the blood of Christ; so that your divinity may be made known to all and in all, being glorified with the Father, equal in honor, one in will and one in lordship most praised.
The People
Chosen of God, O blessed holy priest, you resemble Aaron and Moses the Prophet, who prepared the garments which Aaron always wore.
He fashioned the robe of linen woven of four elements; in scarlet, blue, gold, and purple. Threads upon threads were worked in. The first row was of carbuncle.
And the anointing oil runs down the hem of the garments. And during this awesome process the earth resounded and the tabernacle rejoiced. Now in the same way Christ forms our Priest.
When you enter into the holy tabernacle, remember therein our dead: When you receive the offering, remember me, the sinner, so that He may have mercy on us at His next coming:
Glory be to the Father, to the glory of the Son, and to the Holy Spirit forever and ever, blessed be Christ forever and ever.
PREPARATION
The Deacon
Bless, Lord.
The Priest
For yours is the compassion, the power, the loving kindness, the strength and the glory unto the ages.
The curtain is closed.
The deacon offers the nshkhar, saying:
Again in peace let us beseech the Lord.
Receive us, save us, and have mercy on us.
And the celebrant makes the sign of the cross over the nshkhar, saying
Blessing and glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
And taking the nshkhar the priest places it in the patten, saying
Remembrance of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is seated on the throne not made with hands.
He accepted the death of the cross for mankind.
Bless, praise and exalt him for ever.
The deacon offers the wine, saying
Again in peace let us beseech the Lord.
Receive us, save us, and have mercy on us.
And the priest makes the sign of the cross over the wine, saying
Blessing and glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
Then taking the wine, the priest introduces it crosswise into the chalice, saying
In remembrance of the redeeming economy of our Lord God and Savior Jesus Christ,
Through the fountain of whose blood flowing from his side all creatures have been renewed and made immortal.
Bless, praise and exalt him forever.
And he says the following prayer of St. John Chrysostom.
O Lord our God, who sent our Lord Jesus Christ, the heavenly bread, the food of the whole world, to be savior and redeemer and benefactor, and to bless and to sanctify us; Bless now, Lord, also this presentation and receive this upon your heavenly altar.
Be mindful as the beneficent one, and the lover of mankind, both of those who offer it and of those for whom it is offered and keep us without condemnation in the priestly service of your divine mysteries.
For holy and glorious is the most honorable majesty of the glory of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
Psalm 93
The Lord has reigned, he is clothed with majesty; the Lord is clothed, he has girded himself with strength.
He established the world so that it could not be moved; your throne has been ready; you are from the beginning to everlasting.
The rivers have lifted up, O Lord, the rivers have lifted up their voices; the rivers shall rise in their courses.
From the voice of many waters the waves of the sea became wonderful;
Lord, you on high are wonderful; We greatly trusted your testimonies.
Holiness befits your house, O Lord, for length of days.
Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.
Now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
Then he makes the sign of the cross over the gifts, saying three times
The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the Most High will overshadow you (Lk 1:35).
And the priest adds incense and censes, saying
I offer incense before you, Christ, for a spiritual fragrance. Receive it for a sweet-smelling fragrance into your holy, heavenly and intelligible place of offering.
Send down on us in return the graces and the gifts of your Holy Spirit. And to you we offer glory with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
The curtain is opened.
THE SYNAXIS (MIDDAY OFFICE)
THE CENSING
Censing, the priest comes down into the church together with the deacons, and the processional hymn proper to the day is sung. At the end, he ascends to the altar and worships.
The People
Through the intercession of your virgin Mother, accept the supplications of your servants, O Christ,
Who with your blood have made the holy Church more resplendent than the heavens,
And you have arranged in her the orders of apostles, prophets and holy teachers, to resemble the heavenly hosts.
Today we, classes of priests, deacons, clerks and clergy here assembled,
Offer incense before you, O Lord, as Zachariah did of old.
Accept from us our prayers with offerings of incense, like the sacrifice of Abel, of Noah and of Abraham.
 Through the intercession of your supernal hosts maintain ever unshaken the throne of Armenians.
The Deacon
Bless, Lord.
The Priest
Blessed is the kingdom of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
And the choir sings the Introit [zhamamood] proper to the day.
On Sundays
Only-begotten Son and Word of God and Being immortal, who deigned to take body through the holy Mother of God and Ever-Virgin.
You, unchangeable, became man and you were crucified, O Christ our God, and you trampled down death by death.
You, one of the Holy Trinity, equal in glory with the Father and the Holy Spirit, save us.
The Deacon
Again in peace let us beseech the Lord.
Receive us, save us, and have mercy on us.
Bless, Lord.
The Priest
Blessing and glory to the Father and to the Son and to the holy Spirit, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
♰ Peace unto all.
The People
And with your spirit.
The Deacon
Let us bow down to God.
The People
Before you, O Lord.
The Priest
O Lord our God, whose power is inscrutable and whose glory incomprehensible, whose mercy is beyond measure and compassion infinite, according to your abundant love of mankind, look down upon this your people and upon this holy temple and make abundant your mercy and your compassion to us and to those who pray with us. For to you is befitting glory, dominion and honor, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
And the choir will chant the Midday Psalm  and the Midday Chant proper to the day.
The Priest
Lord our God, save your people and bless your inheritance, preserve the fullness of your Church. Sanctify those who have come to greet in love the beauty of your house. Glorify us by your divine power and forsake not us who have put our trust in you. For yours is the might and the power and the glory unto the ages. Amen.
♰ Peace unto all.
You who have taught us all to pray in common and with one accord and have promised to grant the requests of two or three agreeing together in your name, fulfil now the petitions of your servants as may be expedient for them, granting us in this world knowledge of your truth and in the world to come life everlasting. For you are God beneficent and you love mankind and to you is befitting glory, dominion and honor, now and always and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
THE GOSPEL PROCESSION
The elevation of the Gospel book and the procession with it around the altar expresses our belief that the Gospel is the Word of God. The Gospel’s authority is so vast that in reading it, we encounter not only Christ’s words, but Christ the Lord himself. To him we sing the ancient Christian hymn of the Three Holies, Soorp Asdvadz, proclaiming the one who rose from the dead to be “Holy God, holy and mighty, holy and immortal.”
After Soorp Asdvadz the deacon leads the people in a litany of prayers “for peace for the whole world and stability of the holy church,” and for various categories of people, living and deceased. The choir and people appeal to God after each petition saying, “Lord have mercy.”
The Priest
Lord our God, you, who have established in the heavens the orders and the hosts of angels and archangels for the ministry of your glory, make now the holy angels also enter with our entrance and serve with us and glorify with us your goodness
For yours is might and power and glory unto the ages. Amen.
The Deacon
Be attentive.
One of the deacons, elevating the holy Gospel, goes around the altar.
